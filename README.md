magwa: helping solve the tourism crisis in the canary islands

I started building this project in the autumn of 2024, after learning about the tourism crisis in the Canary Islands. I, like many, want to continue to visit special places such as this one, but I don't want to contribute to the growing economic and ecological disasters (you can read more about this on the application's About page).

I built the frontend using React with Javascript, Formik for validations. I utilized React's Context to set user state globally, allowing the user object to be manipulated in various frontend components. 

The backend was built using Python with Flask and SQL. 

I integrated Formspree for a contact form, and Flask mail exetension for account verification. Additionally, this project uses Flask's Session to verify account ownership. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete their account; create, edit, and delete posts, and create and delete comments on others' posts. Users are able to see other users' profiles and posts, and filter by hashtags. magwa has five backend models, and over twenty client- and server- side routes. I used Bcrypt for database password hashing to ensure data privacy, and the project follows ReSTful conventions for backend routing with full CRUD functionality.
