## magwa: Helping Solve the Tourism Crisis in the Canary Islands 
magwa is a traditional word from the canary islands that means disappointment, grief, or sadness.

## About the Project
I started building this project in the autumn of 2024 after learning about the tourism crisis in the Canary Islands. I want to visit special places like this one without contributing to the growing economic and ecological challenges. [Learn more on the application's About page.]

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with JavaScript, Formik for form validation, React Context for global state management.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask and SQL, using Flask-Session for account verification and Bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Integrations**: Formspree for contact forms, Flask-Mail for account verification emails.
- **Routing**: ReSTful conventions with full CRUD functionality.

## Features
- Users can:
  - Create, edit, and delete accounts.
  - Create, edit, and delete posts.
  - Comment on and delete others' posts.
  - View profiles and filter posts by hashtags.

## How to Use
Download the backend for the project using pipenv install, pipenv install flask_session, pipenv install dotenv, and pipenv install flask_mail. Download the frontend using npm install.

## Future Considerations
- **Community Calendar**: A shared event planning tool.  
- **Trip Planner**: An itinerary builder for sustainable travel.  
- **Friendship Capabilities**: Connect users with similar travel interests.  
- **In-app Messaging**: Allow users to communicate directly.  
- **Filtered Views**: View posts by travelers, local experts, or advertisers.
