        <p><span className="italic">magwa</span> is a traditional word from the canary islands that means disappointment, grief, or sadness. tourism has ravaged the Canary Islands, leading to a reduction in available housing for local inhabitants, adverse environmental impacts, and other negative consequences. the islands have become completely unaffordable for residents, putting a strain on resources, leading to a housing and employment crisis. one-third of the residents of the canary islanda are at risk for homelessness and social exclusion, according to Instituo Nacional de Estadística, Spain's national statistics institute.</p>
        <p>despite protests from the local residents, there has been no tourist tax, no limitations of any kind imposed upon foreigners, and no actual legislative change.</p>
        <p>there are local groups who organize protests such as large public manifestations, vigils, and hunger strikes to raise awareness about the problem. one such local group, Canarias Se Agota, or Canarians are Sold Out, operate under the motto "Nuestros Cuerpos por Nuestra Tierra" -- Our Bodies for Our Land. the british newspaper The Guardian reports that the protests are are backed by various environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, WWF, Ecologists in Action, Friends of the Earth, and SEO/Birdlife. a spokesperson for Carnarias Se Agota, Víctor Martín, told the Guardian, <span className="italic">“The problem isn’t the tourists...[i]t’s a model that was built around, and with the connivance of, a business class that doesn’t want to listen to what needs to be done, and with a political class that serves that business class instead of serving all the citizens.”</span></p>
        <p>however, the collection of eight islands do depend on tourism for a substantial amount of their income.</p>
        <p>how does one visit the canary islands but ensure they are not contributing to the growing number of those in poverty, foreign hotel conglomerates paying their canarian employees below minimum wage, and ecological disasters?</p>
